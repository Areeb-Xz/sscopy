## Team Organization (Roles)
Our team was organized based on a clear division of work and expertise to maximize efficiency and accountability:
- **Prabhkrit Singh** led the **Front-end** using the MERN stack, ensuring the app’s interface was both user-friendly and technically robust.
- **Mohammad Areeb** managed the **Back-end** development, using Java and its frameworks, focusing on server logic and integration.
- **Samarjeet Singh Arora** was responsible for the **Database**, leveraging MongoDB (or MySQL) for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Each member’s contact information was shared, and text messages were the primary communication channel for swift collaboration. This clear role distinction ensured that work did not overlap and each component of the system progressed smoothly.

## Decision Making
Decisions were made collaboratively, prioritizing transparency and group consensus. Communication response time was set to within 1 hour, encouraging prompt feedback and engagement. Major decisions regarding features, technical challenges, or deadline issues were discussed during weekly meetings. All members contributed input, after which a consensus or majority vote determined the path forward. If consensus couldn’t be reached within the meeting, the majority opinion decided the final course.

## Prioritizing User Stories
User stories were prioritized during our weekly meetings. Each feature request or requirement was reviewed and discussed for importance and urgency. When needed, points/priority were assigned through voting or group consensus, following a criteria based on impact, complexity, and time sensitivity. Typically, 1-2 rounds of discussion or voting were sufficient to finalize the point estimate for each user story. This structured approach ensured that the highest-value items were addressed first in each phase of the project.

## Meetings
The team met face-to-face every Friday from 2-5pm at Scott Library. Attendance at meetings was compulsory, and meeting preparation such as reviewing progress and preparing concepts was expected from all members. Members who missed more than three meetings were reported to the instructor and faced removal from the group. These standing meetings supported regular progress reviews, collaborative planning, and troubleshooting in real time, strengthening team cohesion.

## Lessons and Next Phase
Key lessons learned include the value of clear role assignment, accountability, and consistent, transparent communication. Maintaining regular meetings and prepration work was critical to our productivity and morale. For the next phase, we plan to:
- Start working on the front end and backend simultaneously.
- Align our features with our stories in product backlog.
- Work on effective and productive communication.
